# 💸 P2P Stablecoin Adoption on Solana – USDC Transfers

This project explores the peer-to-peer (P2P) usage of **USDC** on the **Solana blockchain**, analyzing how stablecoins are being transferred between wallets for non-custodial, decentralized use cases.

How is the monthly volume of P2P USDC transfers evolving, and what trends are observable in average transfer sizes?
Tracking the transfer volume alongside average transfer sizes provides insights into usage intensity and economic activity within the P2P USDC ecosystem on Solana.

This dashboard is for research and informational purposes only. It does not constitute financial advice or investment recommendations. Data is sourced from on-chain records on Solana and may be subject to inherent limitations such as delays or incompleteness. Users should verify results independently before making decisions.

Data availability:
The data used for this analysis is sourced from publicly available on-chain transaction records on Solana, specifically focusing on USDC token transfers. The dataset excludes transactions involving contracts, decentralized exchanges, or centralized exchange wallets to isolate genuine peer-to-peer activity among retail users. The timeframe covered spans from July 2024 to June 2025.
